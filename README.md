# SemanticCompiler
A program that performs the entire parsing phase (that is the lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis) of a compiler of an invented programming language that is a simplification of the C language, but wich still handles strings, arrays, matrices, pointers with their operations, comparative and iterative operations, and the use of functions.

Running 'Makefile' the compiler will check until the semantic of the 'full_example.c' code. That code have an example of every rule that this simplified C language accept.
